## DevOps Python Tools
=================================


### Hadoop, Spark / PySpark, HBase, Pig, Ambari, IPython and Linux Tools ###

A few of the Big Data, NoSQL & Linux tools I've written over the years. All programs have `--help` to list the available options.

For many more tools see the [DevOps Perl Tools](https://github.com/harisekhon/perl-tools) and [Advanced Nagios Plugins Collection](https://github.com/harisekhon/nagios-plugins) repos which contains many Hadoop, NoSQL, Web and infrastructure tools and Nagios plugins.

##### Make sure you run ```make update``` if updating and not just ```git pull``` as you will often need the latest library submodule and possibly new upstream libraries. #####

### Quick Start ###

#### Ready to run Docker image #####

All programs and their pre-compiled dependencies can be found ready to run on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/harisekhon/pytools/).

List all programs:
```
docker run harisekhon/pytools
```
Run any given program:
```
docker run harisekhon/pytools <program> <args>
```

#### Automated Build from source #####

```
git clone https://github.com/harisekhon/devops-python-tools pytools
cd pytools
make
```

Make sure to read [Detailed Build Instructions](https://github.com/HariSekhon/devops-python-tools#detailed-build-instructions) further down for more information.

Some Hadoop tools with require Jython, see [Jython for Hadoop Utils](https://github.com/harisekhon/devops-python-tools#jython-for-hadoop-utils) for details.

### Usage ###

All programs come with a ```--help``` switch which includes a program description and the list of command line options.

Environment variables are supported for convenience and also to hide credentials from being exposed in the process list eg. ```$PASSWORD```, ```$TRAVIS_TOKEN```. These are indicated in the ```--help``` descriptions in brackets next to each option and often have more specific overrides with higher precedence eg. ```$AMBARI_HOST```, ```$HBASE_HOST``` take priority over ```$HOST```.

You can use this to pre-download all tags of a docker image before running tests across versions in a simple bash for loop, eg. ```docker_pull_all_tags.sh```
  - ```dockerhub_search.py``` - search DockerHub with a configurable number of returned results (official `docker search` is limited to only 25 results), using `--verbose` will also show you how many results were returned to the termainal and how many DockerHub has in total (use ```-q / --quiet``` to return only the image names for easy shell scripting). This can be used to download all of my DockerHub images in a simple bash for loop eg. ```docker_pull_all_images.sh``` and can be chained with ```dockerhub_show_tags.py``` to download all tagged versions for all docker images eg. ```docker_pull_all_images_all_tags.sh```

### Detailed Build Instructions

##### Python VirtualEnv localized installs

The automated build will use 'sudo' to install required Python PyPI libraries to the system unless running as root or it detects being inside a VirtualEnv. If you want to install some of the common Python libraries using your OS packages instead of installing from PyPI then follow the Manual Build section below.


#### Manual Setup

Enter the pytools directory and run git submodule init and git submodule update to fetch my library repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/harisekhon/devops-python-tools pytools
cd pytools
git submodule init
git submodule update
sudo pip install -r requirements.txt
```


#### Offline Setup

Download the DevOps Python Tools and Pylib git repos as zip files:

https://github.com/HariSekhon/devops-python-tools/archive/master.zip

https://github.com/HariSekhon/pylib/archive/master.zip

Unzip both and move Pylib to the ```pylib``` folder under DevOps Python Tools.

```
unzip devops-python-tools-master.zip
unzip pylib-master.zip

mv -v devops-python-tools-master pytools
mv -v pylib-master pylib
mv -vf pylib pytools/
```

Proceed to install PyPI modules for whichever programs you want to use using your usual procedure - usually an internal mirror or proxy server to PyPI, or rpms / debs (some libraries are packaged by Linux distributions).

All PyPI modules are listed in the ```requirements.txt``` file.

Internal Mirror example ([JFrog Artifactory](https://jfrog.com/artifactory/) or similar):

```
sudo pip install --index https://host.domain.com/api/pypi/repo/simple --trusted host.domain.com -r requirements.txt
```

Proxy example:

```
sudo pip install --proxy hari:mypassword@proxy-host:8080 -r requirements.txt
```

##### Mac OS X

The automated build also works on Mac OS X but you'll need to download and install [Apple XCode](https://developer.apple.com/download/). I also recommend you get [HomeBrew](https://brew.sh/) to install other useful tools and libraries you may need like OpenSSL for development headers and tools such as wget (these are installed automatically if Homebrew is detected on Mac OS X):

```
brew install openssl wget
```

If failing to build an OpenSSL lib dependency, just prefix the build command like so:

```
sudo OPENSSL_INCLUDE=/usr/local/opt/openssl/include OPENSSL_LIB=/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib ...
```

You may get errors trying to install to Python library paths even as root on newer versions of Mac, sometimes this is caused by pip 10 vs pip 9 and downgrading will work around it:

```
sudo pip install --upgrade pip==9.0.1
make
sudo pip install --upgrade pip
make
```

### Jython for Hadoop Utils ###

The 3 Hadoop utility programs listed below require Jython (as well as Hadoop to be installed and correctly configured)

```
hadoop_hdfs_time_block_reads.jy
hadoop_hdfs_files_native_checksums.jy
hadoop_hdfs_files_stats.jy
```

Run like so:
```
jython -J-cp $(hadoop classpath) hadoop_hdfs_time_block_reads.jy --help
```

The ```-J-cp $(hadoop classpath) ``` part dynamically inserts the current Hadoop java classpath required to use the Hadoop APIs.

See below for procedure to install Jython if you don't already have it.

##### Automated Jython Install

This will download and install jython to /opt/jython-2.7.0:

```
make jython
```

##### Manual Jython Install

Jython is a simple download and unpack and can be fetched from http://www.jython.org/downloads.html

Then add the Jython install bin directory to the $PATH or specify the full path to the `jython` binary, eg:

```
/opt/jython-2.7.0/bin/jython hadoop_hdfs_time_block_reads.jy ...
```


#### Configuration for Strict Domain / FQDN validation ####

Strict validations include host/domain/FQDNs using TLDs which are populated from the official IANA list is done via my [PyLib](https://github.com/harisekhon/pylib) library submodule - see there for details on configuring this to permit custom TLDs like ```.local``` or ```.intranet``` (both supported by default).

#### Python SSL certificate verification problems

If you end up with an error like:
```
./dockerhub_show_tags.py centos ubuntu
[SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed (_ssl.c:765)
```
It can be caused by an issue with the underlying Python + libraries due to changes in OpenSSL and certificates. One quick fix is to do the following:
```
sudo pip uninstall -y certifi &&
sudo pip install certifi==2015.04.28
```

### Updating ###

Run ```make update```. This will git pull and then git submodule update which is necessary to pick up corresponding library updates.

If you update often and want to just quickly git pull + submodule update but skip rebuilding all those dependencies each time then run ```make update-no-recompile``` (will miss new library dependencies - do full ```make update``` if you encounter issues).

### Testing

[Continuous Integration](https://travis-ci.org/HariSekhon/devops-python-tools) is run on this repo with tests for success and failure scenarios:
- unit tests for the custom supporting [python library](https://github.com/harisekhon/pylib)
- integration tests of the top level programs using the libraries for things like option parsing
- [functional tests](https://github.com/HariSekhon/devops-python-tools/tree/master/tests) for the top level programs using local test data and [Docker containers](https://hub.docker.com/u/harisekhon/)

To trigger all tests run:

```
make test
```

which will start with the underlying libraries, then move on to top level integration tests and functional tests using docker containers if docker is available.
